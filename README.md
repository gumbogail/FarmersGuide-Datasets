Hello, so this is me trying to figure out machine learning and predictive modelling. i am TRYING to make models that predict storms and droughts in Namibia. 
it is my first time EVER working with machine learning and im definitely learning as i go . Youre welcome to tag along for the ride :)
here you will see a number of datasets that contain weather data specific to namibia. i did some feature engnering and used the data to train drought occurrence models , drought severity models and rainfall prediction models .
